<!-- I am a final-year Ph.D. student of Zhejiang University, supervised by [Prof. Siliang Tang（汤斯亮）](https://person.zju.edu.cn/siliang/684099.html). Meanwhile, I am a research intern in AntGroup mentored by [YongChao Liu]().

My research interest includes Self-Supervised Graph Representation Learning, Graph Transfer Learning, Domain Generalization, Large Language Models and Graph Foundation Models. -->

<!-- We have proposed the first model-agnostic recipe for improving OOD generalization of graph contrastive learning ([MARIO](https://github.com/ZhuYun97/MARIO/tree/main)), and the first self-aligned graph contrastive learning framework ([RoSA](https://github.com/ZhuYun97/RoSA)).

Recently, we propose an efficient tuning and inference algorithm for LLMs on textual graphs, named [ENGINE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15569), which effectively and efficiently combine GNN and LLMs through a side structure. -->

<!-- We release the [first survey of GraphRAG]() which formalize the GraphRAG workflow, encompassing Graph-Based Indexing, Graph-Guided Retrieval, and Graph-Enhanced Generation. 

Recently, we propose a new [Graph Foundation Model]() which has strong cross-domain/task transferability.

I am expected to graduate in June 2025 and seeking postdoctoral job opportunities. Please feel free to [contact me](zhuyun_dcd@zju.edu.cn) if you are interested! -->


I am a final-year Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University under the supervision of [Prof. Siliang Tang (汤斯亮)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/siliang/684099.html), and a research intern at AntGroup, mentored by [YongChao Liu (刘永超)](https://yongchao-liu.github.io/). My research focuses on Self-Supervised Graph Representation Learning, Graph Transfer Learning, Large Language Models, and Graph Foundation Models.

We recently released the [first comprehensive survey on GraphRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08921), which formalizes the GraphRAG workflow, covering Graph-Based Indexing, Graph-Guided Retrieval, and Graph-Enhanced Generation. Additionally, we introduced a novel [Graph Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10329) that demonstrates strong cross-domain and cross-task transferability.

I expect to graduate in June 2025 and am actively looking for a job. If interested, please feel free to [contact me](zhuyun_dcd@zju.edu.cn).

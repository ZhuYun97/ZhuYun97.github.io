I am a Ph.D. student of Zhejiang University, supervised by [Prof. Siliang Tang（汤斯亮）](https://person.zju.edu.cn/siliang/684099.html). I obtained my B.S. degree at Zhejiang University of Technology. 

My research interest includes Self-Supervised Graph Representation Learning, Graph Transfer Learning, Domain Generalization and Large Language Models. 
<!--I have published six papers includes WWW, IJCAI, ECAI, et.al.-->

We have proposed the first model-agnostic recipe for improving OOD generalization of graph contrastive learning ([MARIO](https://github.com/ZhuYun97/MARIO/tree/main)), and the first self-aligned graph contrastive learning framework [RoSA](https://github.com/ZhuYun97/RoSA).
 

I am expected to graduate in June 2025 and seeking job opportunities. Please feel free to [contact me](zhuyun_dcd@zju.edu.cn) if you are interested!

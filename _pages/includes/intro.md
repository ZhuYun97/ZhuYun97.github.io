I am a final-year Ph.D. student of Zhejiang University, supervised by [Prof. Siliang Tang（汤斯亮）](https://person.zju.edu.cn/siliang/684099.html). I obtained my B.S. degree at Zhejiang University of Technology. 

My research interest includes Self-Supervised Graph Representation Learning, Graph Transfer Learning, Domain Generalization, Large Language Models and Graph Foundation Models.

We have proposed the first model-agnostic recipe for improving OOD generalization of graph contrastive learning ([MARIO](https://github.com/ZhuYun97/MARIO/tree/main)), and the first self-aligned graph contrastive learning framework ([RoSA](https://github.com/ZhuYun97/RoSA)).

Recently, we propose an efficient tuning and inference algorithm for LLMs on textual graphs, named [ENGINE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15569), which effectively and efficiently combine GNN and LLMs through a side structure.

I am expected to graduate in June 2025 and seeking postdoctoral job opportunities. Please feel free to [contact me](zhuyun_dcd@zju.edu.cn) if you are interested!
